##Final Project Idea

For my final project, I wanted to build something that I wish existed but couldn't find. My idea is a writing prompt app for people who want to write every day. Taking an idea from Anne Lamott in _Bird by Bird_, a user would generate a random prompt and be encouraged to write 300 words based on that prompt.

The "why" of the project is getting people to practice writing every day so that they develop their skills and create a habit of writing about a variety of subjects. The app would have a database of prompts in a minimum of 3 different categories (i.e. humor, dark, philosophy). The MVP is a web app where users can click "generate" and get a random prompt from their selected category. Web and mobile apps like this already exist, but I was disappointed with the design and user experience. 

Other goals for the app are:
- Creating a form for the user to write in the app.
- Creating a way for users to save their work, email their work, or share to social media.
- Creating a way for users to submit new prompts (which the admin would have to approve -- probably just an email form)

Stetch goals (these would require working with a backend developer more)
- Creating a user login in system
- Tracking leaders by most consecutive days written
- Creating a place for users to post their writing on the site and vote on the best
